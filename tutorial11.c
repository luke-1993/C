// C provides numerous methods for working with files
// A file is just a block of memory with a name
// The file can be stored across many blocks in memory, 
// but the C compiler acts as if it is in sequence.

// In this tutorial I will cover how to work with files
// if we represent them as text files. next time I'll cover how
// to use Binary File I/O
